PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intention
Lib-Testdata
 - A simple testdata-generation framework in context from my Naoghuman libraries.

Lib-Testdata-Core
 - Contains an start-class for the testdata-generation framework.
 - Contains functionalities to register entities.
    - Registered entities will display in the Navigation.
 - Contains functionalities to execute the registered tasks.
    - Need a mapping-id for the entitiy and the task testdata-generation.
    - The task for the t-g needs a component for the configuration from the task
      (generation-time, numbers...).
 
Lib-Testdata-Demo
 - Contains a example start-class which starts the testdata-generation framework.
 - Contains the registration from the database name.
 - Contains the registration from example entities.
 - Contains the registration from the testdata-generation for every entity.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Basic project structure in GitHub
    - (v) 1 Work-Day 14.08.2017

2) Basic framework layout
    - (v) Left side is the navigation, right side the testdata-generation area.
    - (v) 2 Work-Day 

3) Basic functionalities to register an entity.
    - (v) The registered entity have a mapping-id (entity / task)
    - (v) A registered entity will shown in the Navigation.
    - (v) CheckBox 'select-all' (dis)select all entities in Navigation.
    - (v) Button "Resolve" for Navigation
       - (v) Select all not-selected previous required entities in the Navigation.
    - (v) Button "Show" for Navigation
       - (v) Is only avaiable if all 'previous required entitties' are checked,
             which means if the button 'Resolve' is clicked.
       - (v) If the button 'Show' is clicked internal the resolve functionality
             will execute ones more (for the case that the developer have changed
             the selection in the navigation.
       - (v) Shows all selected entities in 'testdata-generation-area'.
       - (v) Configuration components will filled initial.
    - (v) The registered entities will be sorted
           - (v) alphabetically
           - (v) first all entities without any 'previous required entities' will
                 be shown.
           - (v) Then the order is that all 'previous required entities' will be
                 so sorted, that they are before the caller entity.
    - (1) 2 Work-Days

4) Basic functionalities to execute a registered task.
    - (v) All primary values from the opened ConfigurationComponent are available 
          if the developer click on the button 'Create Testdata'.
    - (v) Create an new abstract class TestdataService.
           - (v) Developer can register a Task in EntityContainer.
                  - (v) Automatically a concrete TestdataService with the Task
                        and ConfigurationComponent will generated and stored.
                  - (v) Click on 'Create Testdata' will then execute the service.
    - ( ) 2 Work-Days

5) Basic functionalites to register the database
    - (v) 1 Work-Day

6) Extended functionalities for the testdata generation
    - ( ) Executing more the ones (button 'Create Testdata') will execute every 
          time the developer settings.
    - ( ) Extend every entity with some attributes.
    - ( ) Create for every entity a task.
    - ( ) Tweak StartDemoTextdataGeneration.

7) Documentation Lib-Testdata
    - ( ) 2 Work-Day

ADDITIONAL
LoremIpsum
 - Register methods to register in the class arrays with data.
 - Methods to get dynamic data (which need before registerd).

Lib-Testdata-Core
 - Own properties.file
    - attributes like in ABC-List -> "Testdata Generation Framework vX.Y.Z"
